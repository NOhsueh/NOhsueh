There is a scene in the Animal World. A group of sika deer are running on the African continent, followed by a group of lions. Suddenly a sika deer was caught, and the lions began to enjoy it. The herds of deer found that after a deer was caught, they stopped running and watched the lions gnawing at their fellow clan, day after day, until the earth was destroyed.
